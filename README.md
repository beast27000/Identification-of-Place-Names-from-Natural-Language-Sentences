# Identification-of-Place-Names-from-Natural-Language-Sentences
This project identifies place names from Twitter messages using NLP techniques. It leverages tools like transformers, spaCy, and PyTorch to handle complex sentence structures, extract spatial data, and process real-world, unstructured text efficiently.

### Project Summary

**Title:** Identification of Place Names from Natural Language Sentences

This project aims to extract and identify place names from complex natural language texts. The approach leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to accurately identify place names in diverse contexts, even when the sentences are ambiguous or complex. The system is designed to handle part-of-speech tagging and spatial data extraction efficiently, providing robust results across various datasets. The input data for this project includes Twitter messages, making it capable of processing real-world, unstructured text.

**Key Features:**
- Extracts place names from natural language sentences.
- Handles ambiguous and complex sentence structures.
- Utilizes advanced NLP techniques for part-of-speech tagging and spatial data processing.
- Designed for scalability and integration into larger systems.
